        - Added another test for a wrong solution.
        - Extracted two classes from Games::Solitaire::Verify::State :
            - lib/Games/Solitaire/Verify/Foundations.pm
            - lib/Games/Solitaire/Verify/Freecells.pm
        - Added List::Util to the "requires" - it was missing.

        - Fixed the script with the absolute path on Makefile.PL
        - Moved bin to script because it's written in pure-Perl.

        - Fixed various bugs:
            - incompatible output between what we had and Freecell Solver
            (trailing whitespace etc.)
            - Added a test assertion for verifying that a wrong solution is
              wrong. (which uncovered the bugs.)
            - Fixed the solution verification logic.

        - First version.
        - Can only do Freecell for now, but there's a lot of modularity
        and extensibility infrastrucutre in place.
        - 193 Test Assertions.
