        - Fixed various bugs:
            - incompatible output between what we had and Freecell Solver
            (trailing whitespace etc.)
            - Added a test assertion for verifying that a wrong solution is
              wrong. (which uncovered the bugs.)
            - Fixed the solution verification logic.

        - First version.
        - Can only do Freecell for now, but there's a lot of modularity
        and extensibility infrastrucutre in place.
        - 193 Test Assertions.
