Games-Solitaire-Verify

This is a CPAN Perl module that verifies the solutions of various variants
of card Solitaire. It does not aim to try to be a solver for them, because
this is too CPU intensive to be adequately done using perl5 (as of 
perl-5.10.0). If you're interested in the latter, look at:

* http://fc-solve.berlios.de/

* http://fc-solve.berlios.de/links.html#other_solvers

Instead, what Games-Solitaire-Verify does is verify the solutions
and makes sure they are correct.

See http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/ for more about card solitaire.
